# What is this?
<p>
This is the "Scripts" folder from my Unity project for a game I'm working on called <em>Upgrade!</em>. I will be pushing all of the changes I make to the scripts all the way up until the release
of the game.

My Local Repository: Upgrade\!/Assets/Scripts

GitHub Repository: KleemoffDeveloper/Upgrade-Game-Scripting

# Why post this on GitHub?
<p>
It's important for potential employers/team members to be able to physically see your work. Feel free to comment on my code and suggest best practices, etc...
For more information about this project visit my other repository for the game <a href="https://github.com/KleemoffDeveloper/Upgrade-Game-Git">here</a>.
